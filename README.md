 Approach:-
 I have  used  DFS algorithm to find the path between the modules. use simple states to mark the start , the end and all of the visited node. when we select start and end then the DFS algo runs automatically and traverse through all of the possible path till it find the eaxct path to the end node.

Tech Used:- 
Vite 
React

Setup Instructions

1. just go to the foler location and run command 
  npm i
2. and after installing all node modules run
   npm run dev
